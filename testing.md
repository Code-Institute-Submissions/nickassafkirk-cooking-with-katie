## Compatibility

Compatibility testing involved going through the site thoroughly to ensure that the format, layout, styles and functionality of the site perform as intended. 

Testing involved: 


1. Testing the site using multiple browsers to ensure cross-browser compatibility.
   The following browsers were tested for the current deployed version of this site:

   | Browser       | Compatible |
   | --------------|------------|
   | Chrome        |   &#9745;  |
   | Safari        |   &#9745;  |
   | Firefox       |   &#9745;  |
   | Opera         |   &#9745;  |
   | Microsoft Edge|   &#9745;  |

   Unfortunately it was not possible to test the site functionality on internet explorer as no version was available for IOS. 

1. Testing the site across a range of devices to ensure a responsive site that provides a great user experience on all devices.
   The site was tested on: 

   | IOS           |           
   |Iphone 6s Plus |             
   |Iphone SE      |  
   |Iphone XS      |
   |Ipad Mini      |
   
1. Testing the site using chrome dev tools to confirm desired functionality across all breakpoints and screen-widths. 

1. Additional testing was carried out by asking friends and family to test the site and to provide feedback on a range of devices. 

1. while I didn't personally test the site on android or windows devices due to lack of access to these devices, I had several friends test the site on windows and android mobiles.
All of whom reported that the site was working as intended.

## User Story Testing

## Manual Testing

## Bugs

## Remaining bugs to be fixed:

1. The Recipe cards on the recipes page and account recipes section do not scale evenly. While this does not affect the functionality, it is cosmetically 
ugly and will be fixed in future. Unfortunately due to time constraints this issue could not be resolved yet but I plan on using flex grid to achieve the desired functionality
dyring future development of this project.

1. When account page is refreshed after form submission etc... it reloads on the default account details section. This provides a confusing user experience. 
To remedy this I could create new pages with a dedicated rout for each page. Or I could use session cookies to store the last visited page section. Unfortunately due to time onstraints
this could not be resolved before the project was due to be submitted.
